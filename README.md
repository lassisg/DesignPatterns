# Design Patterns

*Implementing the GoF Design Patterns in C#*

> This README file is a work in progress. As I walk through the contents, I'll add more content... 

Considering the great importance and impact that the content of this book has in the developers community, it's definitely a base reading/studying.
Since I'm a .NET/C# developer, it only makes sense to recreate the book examples in C#.

The main intention is to have a place to store the patterns in a language that I'm a little bit more comfortable with.

As I believe that knowledge should be shared, although I don't expect that much attention, I decided to make this public since the very beginning.

As mentioned, this book is a must read. As I haven't already read it, I didn't even bother to search for C# implementations of the examples.
The idea is to learn by coding.
